# 🎻 **Interactive Narrative Game: Museum of Music Bologna**

*— Final Project for the “Digital Heritage and Multimedia” Course, Unibo DHDK*

## **Project Overview**

This project is the final assignment for the **Digital Heritage and Multimedia** course within the
 **DHDK (Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge)** programme at the University of Bologna.

The game is inspired by the **Museo Internazionale e Biblioteca della Musica di Bologna**, transforming its rich musical heritage, historical documents, and instrument collections into an interactive narrative experience.

Players take on the role of the protagonist, exploring the museum while uncovering story elements, solving puzzles, and gradually unlocking the mysterious sounds heard in a dream.

------

## 🎮 **Gameplay Overview**

Players can freely explore multiple rooms of the museum, interacting with musical instruments, manuscripts, paintings, exhibits, and narrative characters.

Each room corresponds to a different thematic focus, such as:

- The evolution of musical thought
- Early musical instruments
- 18th–19th century opera culture
- Composers such as Rossini, Martucci, and Respighi
- Musical manuscripts, theoretical treatises, and collecting traditions

As the player progresses, the fragmented “sound memories” hidden in the dream slowly come together.
